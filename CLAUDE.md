**Keep this file up to date.** Proactively update it as you learn about
the project. Keep style terse — no filler, no restating what's readable
from source.

# Project

**srcery** orchestrates dependencies and workflows across the yeet-src
multi-repo project (sibling directories under `yeet/`). Mostly lightweight
scripts that call into real code in those other repos.

# Nix

Optional. Flake provides a nixpkgs pin and dev shell. `nix develop` or direnv.
